OVERVIEW
--------
Auto Purge Users
Auto Purge Users lets administrators delete inactive users
based on time conditions. Users are selected as per criteria
that check for different types of user inactivity.
Some of the criteria that are used to select users are

•    Those who exceed a configured period of inactivity
•    Those who have not activated their account since registration
•    Those who have not logged in for a long period can be auto-purged.

The users who are purged can be notified that their account
has been purged. Optionally you can limit the purge to specific
roles like anonymous, etc.. UsersYou can go to
“Administer -> People -> Auto Purge Users” to configure the duration
 of account inactivity, status of account and filter the users by roles.

Users can be deleted automatically on cron by enabling
the auto purge option in configuration page or can be
deleted manually by pressing the delete users button.
Users deleted during cron are logged via the watchdog.
